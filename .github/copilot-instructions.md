This project is a Python PyQt5-based 3D printing toolpath (G-code) editor. The main script should:
- Open a GUI window for selecting a G-code file.
- Ensure a file is selected before editing or saving.
- Provide a 'Save As' option for edited G-code.
- Leave a placeholder for a future 3D G-code viewer integration.
